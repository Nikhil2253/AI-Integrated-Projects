# 🧠 AI-Integrated-Projects

This repository is a dedicated space for my future full-stack projects **built with AI as an assistant in the development workflow**.  
The idea is simple: **Use AI to generate or accelerate backend logic, API design, database schema, and frontend integration** — then refine it manually for production.

---

## 💡 Purpose

> **"Don't just code faster. Code smarter — with AI."**

This repo represents a shift in my development process:
- **AI as a pair programmer**, not just a code suggestion tool
- Using AI to scaffold full-stack logic (models, routes, auth, services)
- Quick iterations from idea to deployable MVP
- Saving time on boilerplate, focusing more on product thinking

---

## 🧱 Core Stack

All projects will follow a consistent, production-ready full-stack stack:

- ⚙️ **Backend**: Node.js / Express OR Python (FastAPI)
- 🧠 **AI APIs**: OpenAI / Claude / Local LLMs
- 🗄️ **Database**: PostgreSQL / MongoDB (Prisma or Mongoose)
- 🌐 **Frontend**: React / Next.js
- 📦 **State & Logic**: Zustand / React Query / Axios
- 🚀 **Deployment**: Railway / Vercel / Render

## 🧠 What AI Is Used For

AI is integrated into:
- Model/schema generation
- API route scaffolding
- Validation logic
- Data seeding
- CRUD boilerplate generation
- Feature planning & project structure decisions

No fancy UI prompts or drag-and-drop tools. Just raw AI + dev logic.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each AI-generated full-stack app will live in its own directory.
